# Write a function merge_ranges() that takes a list of multiple meeting time ranges and returns a list of condensed
# ranges. A meeting is stored as a tuple â†´ of integers (start_time, end_time). These integers represent the number
# of 30-minute blocks past 9:00am.
#
# [(0, 1), (3, 5), (4, 8), (10, 12), (9, 10)]
# [(0, 1), (3, 8), (9, 12)]
